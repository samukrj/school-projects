# Binary Tree Demo (C)

A small school project written in C that demonstrates how a simple binary tree can be built and processed using pointers and recursion.

The program creates a static tree with nodes **A–G** and shows:

- printing the tree with indentation  
- searching for a specific value  
- counting all nodes  
- freeing dynamically allocated memory  

It is intended as practice for working with pointers, structs, and recursive functions.

## Example Output
Tree root: A
-A
-B
-G
-F
-C
-E
-D

Item ‘D’ was found in the tree.
Total number of nodes in the tree: 7

## How to run

Compile:
gcc binaryTree.c -o binaryTree

Run:
./binaryTree


## Notes
This project is based on a class assignment.
