# school-projects (C)

This folder contains small C programs created as part of university coursework.
Each project focuses on a specific concept — recursion, pointers, structs, input validation, or basic parsing.

The goal of these projects is to practice writing clean C code, understand low-level behavior, and work with dynamic memory.
